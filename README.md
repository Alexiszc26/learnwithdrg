## What is This?

There is a lot you will find in this repo, including:
- The code I write during my live streams
- Links to useful resources for learning to code

## A community? Really?

While this repo was mostly a place to me to put down things I found interesting that I thought you might also find interesting, I also want it to be a collaborative place!

If you have a question about something, open up an issue! I'd love to chat about it with you! And while you're there, check out some of the questions other folks have asked, maybe you have a better answer than me!

Did you attend one of my talks? SHAWEET - check out my [Talks with Dr G](https://github.com/sguthals/talkswithdrg) repo for resources I mention in talks!

If you have a sample project that you want to share, let me know! I'd love to highlight it in a blog, or try it out myself in my [Build with Dr G](https://github.com/sguthals/talkswithdrg) repo and add some guides around it as I learn it too :) (Don't worry, I will of course credit you and link to your original work!)
